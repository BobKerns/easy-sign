# npm-template

This lays out a common project structure, and is hello-world buildable out of the box.
It focuses on providing an easy-to-understand starting point for integrating
with typescript and the [rollup](https://www.rollupjs.org) packager.

Rather than trying to set up to handle every possible variation, the intent of this
template is to be opinionated about how a project should be organizedâ€”and then do that well.

I think the narrow focus serves the user better. Even if you chose a different path,
it makes it easier to understand and to know how you wish to deviate.

## Primary organization

The important files are the outputs included in the published module, and the sources that
produce them. The rest are supporting mechanisms.

## package.json

This describes the package, it's role in the world
